      - title: Abdominal Medical Images Segmentation with CNN-Transformer Hybrid Model
        time: Jan - Apr 2022
        link: https://yinnnywy.github.io/545.pdf
        intro: Deep Learning, CV | Group Project
        details: |
                - To solve failure in small and direction-dependent objects detection, and problem of fragmental edges in generated segmented objects, proposed two novel hybrid models, UT-Fuse and Swin-Fuse, for medical image segmentation;
                - Implemented novel hybrid models by fusing representations from parallel CNN and Transformer branches; 
                - Reimplemented TransFuse, ResUNet, TransUNet, SwinUNet, and UTNet as baseline models on Synpase Multi-organ dataset for comparison;
                - UT-Fuse and Swin-Fuse outperform almost all other models in mean DICE score and mean HD95, and have stronger capability of restoring edges in generated segmented objects;
                - UT-Fuse is able to detect small and direction-dependent objects compared to other Transformer-based models.
      - title: Model-based RL with DDPG for Arbitrarily Positional Grasp
        time: Jan - Apr 2022
        link: https://yinnnywy.github.io/598.pdf
        intro: Deep Reinforcement Learning | Group Project
        details: |
                - To solve the allocation problem of computational resources due to high-dimensional continuous space and sparsely sampled data, proposed and implemented a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, Model-based MPC RL with DDPG, for arbitrarily positional reaching;
                - Implemented DDPG and TD3 variants as model-free only baseline algorithm for comparison;
                - Novel algorithm outperforms baseline with improved training stability and faster convergence with higher rewards;
                - Proposed a new advanced version of our model-based RL algorithm, Model-based MPPI RL with DDPG and HER, to apply the model-based RL with the model-free algorithm in the real-time and real-world online learning.
      - title: Automatic Abstractive Long-Span Document Summarization 
        time: Dec - Dec 2021
        link: https://yinnnywy.github.io/595.pdf
        intro: Deep Learning, NLP | Group Project
        details: |
                -	Proposed and implemented a novel BART-based model utilizing Longformer self-attention to reduce the complexity of Transformer model to linear and maintain full sequence representation;
                -	To solve heavy memory usage and compute requirements, adopted explicit Multitask Content Selection for inference-time content selection;
                -	Implemented models by modifying full self-attention of BART with different attention patterns, including local self-attention and sparse self-attention, for comparison;
                -	BART with Longformer self-attention achieves higher ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 score than BART with other attention patterns.
      - title: Transformer Model for Enhancing MirrorGAN-Based Text-to-Image Generation 
        time: Oct - Dec 2021
        link: https://yinnnywy.github.io/592.pdf
        intro: Deep Learning, CV | Group Project
        details: |
                -	Proposed a novel Transformer-and-GAN-based model for better Text-to-Image quality;
                -	Reproduced AttnGAN and MirrorGAN as baseline models;
                -	Adopted and implemented Fréchet Inception Distance as a new metric and other common metrics for this task;
                -	Implemented the novel model by modifying the text-encoder of MirrorGAN with pretrained BERT model;
                -	Compared the results qualitatively and quantitatively; comparison results shows that the novel model improves the diversity of generated images and requires less training time.
